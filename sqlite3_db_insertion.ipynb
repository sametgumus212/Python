However, six of the borrowers replied in writing, stating that they duly service their loans, with no payments in arrears. The two companies that\\xa0did not send replies are Blagoevgrad BT and Transpekt. Shortly after he stepped in office as caretaker Economy Minister\\xa0in early May, Petkov said he was shocked to find that eight companies had received a total of 946 million leva in loans from\\xa0the BDB. He argued that was at odds with the BDB Act and the Bank\\'s Statutes. The BDB is supposed to lend to small and medium-sized businesses. Meanwhile, the Economy Ministry, which exercises the State\\'s ownership rights for the BDB, made changes in the Bank\\'s Audit Committee and moved for the dismissal of two members of the Bank\\'s Supervisory Board. Also, BDB\\'s Statues were amended, capping loans at five million leva. Asked if he will contact the two companies that did not provide information about their loans, Petkov said that his task was to make sure that the taxpayers\\' money is used \"for the right purpose and in the most efficient manner, and that there are no problems with the loans\". He also said that his task was \"to make the BDB work\", adding that financing should be available to\\xa0export-oriented businesses. Regarding the only one of the eight borrowers that had confirmed\\xa0participation in Friday\\'s meeting, Navigation Maritime Bulgare,\\xa0Petkov said they sent an exhaustive letter informing in great detail how the borrowed money had been spent. The loan was taken\\xa0out to focus on the company\\'s export activity. Petkov said hearing that the loans are being serviced \"makes him\\xa0happy\". He went on to say that the way the loans were issued and the fact that the borrowers were big companies continued to draw criticism. The Minister argued that the Bank should have lent to SMEs instead, as stipulated by the BDB Act.Petkov said that many alerts had been received by the Economy Ministry from SMEs which did not have access to BDB loans. He said the Ministry is open to dialogue on each rejected loan application that \"was expedient and designed for SMEs\". According to a list released by the Economy Ministry last week, the eight largest BDB beneficiaries include three companies which have received over 140 million leva loans each: the Sunny Day resort and the Blagoevgrad BT cigarette company, both of which are reportedly linked to former MP and business owner Delyan Peevski, and Roadway Construction which is linked by press stories to Roumen \"The Wolf\" Gaytanski. Loans between 115 million and 140 million leva have been provided to Market Investment (Technomarket) and International Investments (again reportedly linked to Peevski). Loans between 60 million and 115 million leva have been provided to each of three companies: Navigation Maritime Bulgare (owned by Kiril and Georgi Domouschiev), Transpekt (owned by Peter Gospodinov and Georgi Atanassov) and Insa Oil (Georgi Samouilov).

Vassilev said that the work is underway on a programme for business recovery.

The Finance Minister that the budget will be restructured to the\\xa0tune of 810 million leva, adding that a large part of this amount is capital expenditure, as well as other budget outlays.

The committee includes six judges from appellate\\xa0courts and the Military Appellate Court, and 12 magistrates from the SCC selected on a random basis.Meeting on Wednesday evening, the SCC-CC General Assembly observed that the 12 SCC magistrates did not learn of their election to the investigative committee until Wednesday afternoon, although they were elected earlier.The first thing that the supreme judges object to is a number of\\xa0uncertainties about the objective of the probe and the legal basis on which the investigative committee was built. If the probe is motivated by plans to close the specialized judicial authorities, it represents unacceptable encroachment on the exclusive competence of the legislature,SCC-CC recalled that there is a special judicial body in charge of conducting probes - that is, the SJC Inspectorate, which controls the organization of the administrative activities of the courts. The supreme judges also find it inexplicable why the\\xa0investigative committee does not include SJC-JC representatives. They even propose that the analysis be conducted by retired SCC judges of undoubted competence and integrity.SCC-CC accused SJC-JC of overstepping their powers by tasking SCC judges with an activity for which there is no legal regulation. The supreme magistrates further argued that SCC, as a court of last instance, exercises control over the two specialized courts\\' decisions, which means that the work of the Appellate Specialized Criminal Court is analyzed all the time through the mechanisms of higher instance control.

Georgiev, as well as former prime minister\\xa0Boyko Borissov, said the change was prompted by the work of the\\xa0secret services against \"the Russian spy networks\" in this country. Plamen Tonchev, who currently heads a regional SANS division, has been nominated to replace Georgiev. Later in the day, President Rumen Radev signed a decree dismissing Dimiter Georgiev from the position. By another decree, the president appointed Plamen Tonchev as SANS head, said the Presidential Press Secretariat.The Prime Minister said that Georgiev has harmed the reputation of SANS and gave rise to suspicions that he undertook politically-motivated acts at a position which is de-politicized\\xa0by law. Shortly after the appointment of the caretaker government in early May, Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov said that the heads of SANS and of the State Intelligence Agency (SIA), Dimiter Georgiev and Atanas Atanassov, had gone on a long unpaid leave, until September, which is even longer than the caretaker government\\'s expected life. It was widely believed that the move\\xa0sought to thwart their replacement by the caretaker government.\\xa0The two were summoned by the caretaker Prime Minister but they sent their deputies to the meeting. Some time after that, they went to the Council of Ministers but the Prime Minister was unable to meet them. In the meantime, Georgiev and Atanassov terminated their unpaid leave. The security services\\' situation worsened after the Right-wing Democratic Bulgaria coalition, one of the newcomers in the short-lived Parliament that was elected on April 4, said they have information about illegal wiretapping of opposition politicians in the run-up to the April elections. The information was confirmed by Interior Minister Rashkov, who also\\xa0claimed that evidence is being destroyed in SANS. Checks have already started into the alleged wiretapping but no results have been announced.\\xa0 Approached by a reporter whether more dismissals can be expected\\xa0in the services, and the Intelligence Agency in particular, Yanev said that \"the public will be informed when the government\\xa0makes a decision\". Yanev stressed that integrity and professionalism are the main criteria for assessing the performance of the holders of top positions in the services and the entire administration. \"If we find that problems exist with these qualities, we will make the necessary change,\" Yanev said. He added that such changes will be made only at the management level - \"people who do not show professionalism, integrity and commitment to the positions they hold\". \"All other employees in the administration should not be worried, we are not going to undertake purges,\" he said.He also said that the caretaker government does not intend to revise organizational rules, reduce budget outlays or cut positions. In a Facebook video posted shortly after the decision to fire Georgiev was made public, GERB leader and former prime minister Boyko Borissov said that \"the sole reason for the dismissal of the heads of the services and SANS in particular, is that they cracked the spy networks of Russia\". He was referring to the March 22 expulsion of two Russian diplomats for violating the Vienna Convention, which came on the\\xa0heels of the arrest of six persons, including several present and former Bulgarian defence officials and military intelligence\\xa0officers, on suspicion of spying for Russia. Speaking during a meeting with GERB\\'s youth chapter on Wednesday, Borissov said that he \"is ready to take a bet that no\\xa0more Russian spies will be exposed\". He described the caretaker government\\'s actions as \"revenge-seeking\".In a comment to reporters, Georgiev said as far as he was concerned, the only explanation for his dismissal is SANS\\' work for \"breaking up spy networks, especially the most recent ones with the capture of the spies who worked for Russia\". He noted that he had worked with Yanev in another caretaker cabinet but had no such issues with him then. Yanev was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense in the caretaker government of Ognyan Gerdzhikov from January 27 to May\\xa04, 2017. Georgiev also said that the first information required by Yanev when he was appointed caretaker Prime Minister was \"about the spy scandal\" with Russia. Georgiev said that all people working in SANS are professionals worthy of respect and that SANS was discharging its lawful powers, \"with much work done against oligarchs and spies\". \"The spy scandal and the oligarchs, this was something that had not been touched for years,\" he said. Georgiev said that two years ago caretaker Interior Minister Rashkov had his classified information clearance withdrawn for a\\xa0term of three years. The dismissed SANS head said that he had worked with five governments and it is wrong to say that he is \"politically affiliated\". Regarding the alleged wiretapping of politicians, Georgiev said that on Tuesday he sent a report to the caretaker Prime Minister\\xa0with the conclusion that the allegations were not proved. He said that the unit for overseeing the use of special surveillance means is checking SANS for possible illegal wiretapping of politicians.Responding to the attacks from the former power-holders that the\\xa0caretaker government was trying to capture the State, Yanev said what they were really trying to do is \"free the State from legally non-conforming practices and make sure that the state institutions work in the interest of the public and in compliance with rules and laws\". In a comment for the press, Bulgarian Socialist Party leader Kornelia Ninova said she presumes that the caretaker Prime Minister has proof that the services \"were used for political purposes\". Ninova said that Yanev and the cabinet must have information about this, otherwise they would not have decided on\\xa0replacing SANS\\' head. Democratic Bulgaria co-chairman Hristo Ivanov said that the changes at the security services is not surprising and was \"inevitable\". \"There are many things for which the leadership of\\xa0the services and SANS in particular should be criticized,\" Ivanov said.

Cyril and Methodius and discuss bilateral  relations. In Radev\\'s words, the two sides \"today made important steps  forward in a variety of fields: from infrastructure to investment,  education, assistance.\"    Speaking to the press at a news conference he held jointly with his  host, Radev said that for years the two leaders have had \"good  cooperation, open discussion of all issues and a clear vision of how to  deepen cooperation and how to draw together our common European path\".  \"We continue to broaden cooperation in important areas and especially in  connectivity,\" he said.  The two Presidents had a one-on-one meeting followed by plenary talks of  official delegations of the two countries, and met with representatives  of the Bulgarian minority in Serbia.   \"Today\\'s meeting was important and it showed that when the policy of two  presidents in support of our national minority is persistent rather  than incidental, they achieve good results\", said Radev. He recalled  that during a meeting with representatives of the Bulgarian national  minority in 2018, President Vucic promised that some emergency solutions  would be sought.   What Vucic promised was that women of the Bulgarian community in Serbia  would be allowed to use the typical Bulgarian suffix for female family  names (such as the most common -ova, -eva, -ska), that school-age  children in the Bulgarian minority would have Bulgarian-language  schoolbooks, and that hundreds of thousands of euro would be made  available for Bulgarian-language media outlets.   Radev said that funding for Bulgarian-language media has since increased  dramatically and that Bulgaria will make arrangements for providing  schoolbooks for children of the Bulgarian minority. He added that other  important results were achieved as well.  \"We show with these meetings and with this openness that we are able to  resolve the problems. And more than that, we are able to provide  prospects so that Bulgarians in Serbia can feel free and cherish their  national self-consciousness, identity, roots, language and spirituality  while never forgetting that the condition for that is that they be loyal  citizens of the country they live in, and respect its laws,\" said  Radev.  The Bulgarian President expects to see greater perseverance, activity  and unity in the National Council of the Bulgarian National Minority in  Serbia.  He noted that he was in the company of kind hosts. The sides decided  that a Bulgarian Economy Ministry delegation will arrive in Caribrod  shortly to meet with the Municipal Council and the local business  community to negotiate for future development and Bulgarian investments  in the area. Radev insisted that everything should be done at the  administrative level to ensure that investors from Bulgaria feel  protected in Caribrod. \"I will be glad if more is done, if the Serbian  state does and invests more in this area, but it should be noted that  the things I heard today, the questions and the demands, are things  which I also hear from every municipality back in Bulgaria,\" he said.  President Vucic said Caribrod is not the poorest area in Serbia, there  are many poor places in the country, \"and we know others in the EU who  are not wealthier than us.\" He likely implied that Bulgaria\\'s North-West  has the EU\\'s lowest GDP per capita and the remaining non-capital  regions of Bulgaria are also among the lowest ranking, according to EU  data. Vucic pledged that investments will be made in Caribrod.  The Serbian President also said: \"We are trying, and we are doing our  best. We could use help from Bulgaria if it is offered. We are ready to  help Dimitrovgrad [Caribrod] and Bosilegrad in every way, to let the  people choose their names, leave it up to them to organize their lives.  If someone tries to foment tension over Serbia, you will get nothing but  a friendly response because we regard you as brothers.\" Vucic thanked  Radev for the good relations with Serbia, which he expects to develop  further.  Radev said Bulgarian-Serbian relations are marked by \"friendship,  goodneighbourliness and resolute action for the well-being of our two  peoples.\" Stressing the importance of people-to-people contacts, he said  that 500,000 Serbian tourists visit Bulgaria annually and even more  Bulgarians travel to Serbia. He and Vucic discussed ways to improve  two-way connectivity by expanding the capacity of existing border  crossings and building more crossings so as to allow people to  communicate much more freely, make investments and maintain economic  cooperation.

Thugs Out!  coalition renewed their agreement and will be running together in the  July 11 early general elections. Maya Manolova, the former national  ombudsman who leads one of the partners in the coalition, the  IzpraviSe.bg platform, said Sunday that they have signed a coalition  agreement with the Toxic Trio and Movement 21 of Tatyana Doncheva.  There used to be some intrigue about the future of this coalition  because Movement 21 was a desired partner for the Bulgarian Socialist  Party (BSP) as well. Remarks by BSP leader Kornelia Ninova created the  impression that her party\\'s future partnership with Tatyana Doncheva\\'s  movement was certain to materialize.  Doncheva is a former high-ranking BSP member, and so is Manolova.  \"We will keep our present format,\" Manolova said. \"It is a winning team  which will continue to work for the citizens\\' trust during the  forthcoming elections. We have reaffirmed our priorities: definitive  dismantling of the corrupt mafia-style model, restoring democracy,  justice and the rule of law, raising the incomes of Bulgarian citizens,  ensuring free business competition, updating pensions, and having a  clean and green Bulgaria.\"  Manolova sees growing voter confidence in Rise Up! Thugs Out!, which she thinks is evidenced by opinion polls.  Citizens\\' representatives will make up 70 per cent of the candidates on  the coalition\\'s lists for the upcoming elections, and political nominees  will be 30 per cent, Manolova said.  Commenting on her talks with BSP, Doncheva said she does not think that  \"anyone has taken deliberate steps to blow up any political formation.\"  Doncheva went on to say: \"This is competition. Competition exists in  every contest, including elections. We can raise no hurdles for the  other political entities. The negotiations were fair, everyone who had  to know about them knew about them, and I think the final decision  corresponds to the current needs.\"  Doncheva further commented: \"There is no broad left-wing coalition.  There is a narrow coalition exactly the way it was during the latest  elections. Any additional agreements which are being signed with BSP are  accords on interaction. They make no one a coalition partner or a  participant in the elections, nor do they create any circumstances  provided for in the Election Code.\" LN/VE\\n')\n",

The decision was voted after two hours of debates.The work of the specialized prosecution service will be subject to an analysis after the newcomers in the Parliament, which was elected April 4 and dissolved just over a month later for failing to form a government, moved for disbanding the specialized prosecution services and courts. They argued that these are being used as instruments of repression against opponents of the power-holders. The prosecution service and other advocates of special jurisdictions argued that the proposal was made without even analysing the work of specialized prosecutors and courts. The Justice Minister said that 40 days was perfectly enough and taking longer seems to be aiming to postpone seeing the real results.Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev argued that the Justice Minister\\'s desire to have the analysis accomplished in 40 days was unrealistic and the time not enough for an objective analysis. \"We have never made a commitment to cater to political\\xa0interests, we are not servants to the political class,\" said Geshev.He also said that some politicians want to rush an inadeqiate analysis that would serve the interests of certain political parties and not those of Bulgarian people.He believes it is a good idea to include EU prosecutors in the scrutiny team.

She spoke to the press ahead of a meeting with representatives of tourist businesses. She has set herself the task of improving the policies for regulation of the tourist market and administering tourist activities, while taking care of the safety and health of tourists and tourist staff. Presenting Bulgaria as a safe and hospitable destination, and using all channels for that, is of key importance, Baltova said. Another task is to make sure there is adequate, precise and relevant information for tourist businesses. Developing national tourist advertisement and international cooperation for encouraging tourists to pick Bulgaria as the destination of their choice, is a second priority for the caretaker government. During the short time it has, the government will focus on digital activities. RY/LN//\\n')\n"
